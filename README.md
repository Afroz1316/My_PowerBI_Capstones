# My_PowerBI_Capstones
I have done **Three** projects on **Power BI** one is for **1.)"Diabetes"** and another one is **2.)"African Mobile Data"**.
So, I performed all then below actions to create a "Dashboard and Visuals" to make the data redable.
Analyzed a diabetes dataset using Power BI to identify risk factors and trends.
Created visually appealing dashboards with interactive visualizations.
Conducted in-depth data exploration and provided insights to improve diabetes management.
Analyzed and visualized African mobile data using Power BI.
Developed interactive reports and dashboards to showcase subscriber growth, revenue analysis, and regional performance.
Generated actionable insights for business strategy and decision making.

3.)**VGsales Data Analysis and Visualization Project:**

In this project, I leveraged data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights into video game sales trends using the VGsales dataset. Utilizing Power BI, I transformed raw data into meaningful visualizations and actionable insights.

**Key Achievements:**

**Data Preparation:** Cleaned and structured the VGsales dataset, ensuring consistency in naming conventions and data types for accurate analysis.

**Visual Exploration:** Created a series of interactive visualizations using Power BI, including line charts to showcase global sales trends over time and bar charts to illustrate top-selling games and platforms.

**Genre and Region Analysis:** Utilized treemaps to visualize the distribution of sales across different genres and employed maps to highlight regional variations in sales.

**Developer Impact:** Investigated the relationship between the number of games released by developers and their total sales, revealing insights into industry dynamics.

**Storytelling Narrative:** Constructed a cohesive narrative that weaved together data-driven insights, guiding users through the dataset's implications for the gaming market.

**Interactive Dashboard:**
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to allow users to explore the data dynamically. The dashboard features slicers, filters, tooltips, and navigation elements, enhancing the user experience and enabling focused analysis.

**Business Implications:**
The project's insights offer valuable perspectives for stakeholders in the gaming industry. The identification of top-performing genres, regional trends, and the influence of developers on sales provides actionable recommendations for game development, marketing, and strategic decision-making.
This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling, highlighting my ability to extract valuable insights from raw data and effectively communicate them to diverse audiences.
